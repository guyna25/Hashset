SimpleHashSet.java - Abstract class which contains method that are common for open and closed hash sets

ClosedHashSet.java - a closed hashset implementation

OpenHashSet.java - a open hashset implementation

SimpleSetPerformanceAnalyzer.java - this object measures the running time of various operations with different
 kinds of hashsets

LinkedListWrapper.java -  A wrapper for the linked list to be used to create linked list arrays

CollectionFacadeSet.java - Facade for java's collection

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================

The main methodology of the implementation maximizes encapsulation and simplfying all APIS as much as possbile.
 I also wanted to make debugging as easy as possible so I tried to concentrate each 'job' that needs to get
 done in each file to a single method.
 I chose to use collectionfacadeset, honestly, just because it was a written option in the excercise and I
 wanted to focus more on creating the best hashset I can with my knowledge.
Furthermore, most of the design was dictated by the excercise description

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
Regarding excercise README questions:

-Openhashset's implementation was pretty straight forward from the excercise description. I only had to
seperate the method involving putting values in the hash set from the ones which receive a value to be added
to enable modularity and to make rehashing easier, e.g, hashElement is seperated from add since hashElement is
 used in several places in the code.

 -Deletion in closed hashset was a learning process as intialy I tried to enter an integer constant cast as an
  object but it gave out a arrayStoreExpection since arrays apparently reads the constant as the lowest type
  it is, after some attemps I figured I can reference to a null pointer of a string which enables me to mark
  certain valeus as null but a *specific* null value. This solved the empty flags problem without any bugs.


-Bad results for data1.txt:
-OpenHashset - open hashset is a very blunt way of hashing since it doesn't have any method for collision,
other than jamming all of them at the same place. That means that even as the data entered gets bigger the
time complexity stays the same and does not become more efficent, which means that openhash set takes more and
 more time to hash as you enter more data which makes it a pretty bad method. It can be improbed by
 incorparating a more complex way of hashing to make collisions less common
 -Closed hashing is a bit less space consuming but is definetly as inefficent as open hashing since it hashes
 in a way that does not give a unique identity to none identical strings and therefore many strings can have
 the same hash value, and each string like that increase the run time by a growing rate since every time itll
 collide and will have to further probe throught the array

-Strengths and weaknesses summary
Obviously I wouldn't use my sets for anything because its results were always the worst. Regarding java's sets
 I think hashset is the the best for handling data that has a high number of collisions such as data1 since it
  has the best performance both in searching and adding data. Though for data2 that is uniformly distribuited
  you can see that tree set really shines both in adding and searching for data. I think the names imply the
  reason this happens, since tree set is more focused on storing different objects (like in a binray tree) and
   hashset is more focused on efficently handling the hashing. Linked list seems to be bad for everything, I
   am really sad for the person who wrote that set.

 -compare between close and open
 Both hash sets were rather slow. Open hashset might be better at inserting values but closed hash set it far
 better at searching for strings inside the set. This is due to open hashset using a very rigid way of solving
  collisions - it shoves them into the same place using a linked list. WHile this enables fast inserting it
  makes searching the set quie diffucult

 -compare to java's built in set
 well, once again, open and closed hash set did poorly in comparison to all of them and even to linked list
 which should be somewhat similar. I do believe java's sets are designed better for larger pieces of
  data and have more sophisticated inner mechanism to determine hashcodes. Also, ,my closed and open hash use
  up a lot of memory which wasn't compared in the scope of this excercise and is also important
